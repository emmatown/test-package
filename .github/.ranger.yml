      Hey there ðŸ‘‹

      It looks like you're trying to report an issue without a minimal reproduction. Maintainers only have a finite amount of time and we can't to help as many people as possible if we don't have reproductions that we can easily run.

      There are a couple ways you can provide a minimal reproduction, the easiest and preferred method is [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). If a CodeSandbox isn't suitable, a GitHub repo with a reproduction also works.
